I sang for them, played music for them, and tried to bring them moments of joy in the midst of suffering. Music was our refuge, our shared language against fear and destruction.\n",

They are now all living in a tent together after their family home was bombed. During the bombing that destroyed their home, Jamal’s father was critically wounded and bled to death in front of them, as they stayed by his side, helpless to do anything to keep him with them on this earth. Later, his father's grave site was destroyed, and Jamal was forced to move his father's final resting place — a pain no human should endure.\n\n**On June 9th, 2025, a tiny, beautiful soul entered this world. Jamal’s wife gave birth to their daughter, Thalj, which means “snow.”**\nFor Thalj's family, her birth is a miracle, a source of light in the darkest of times. They are doing everything in their power to find the essentials she needs: baby formula, clean clothes, diapers, safe shelter. But everything in Gaza has become unimaginably expensive. Prices have skyrocketed due to the blockade. What little remains is often sold at prices far beyond what most families can afford, especially those who have lost everything. Her family simply cannot afford her needs alone; let alone money to feed and care for their additional 14 family members.\n\nNow, baby Thalj — just two months old — is growing up in a tent, exposed to the scorching heat by day, freezing temperatures by night, and the constant sound of drones and bombs overhead. There is no safe space for her, no steady supply of formula, no medicine. Her family is trying everything to care for her and their remaining loved ones, but in Gaza, food prices have become impossible, and survival depends entirely on outside support.\n\nDuring one FaceTime call with Jamal, his brother burst into the tent having returned safely from the GHF aid zone carrying a single bag of flour. **_The family hadn’t eaten in five days._ **They started jumping and cheering. His brother collapsed, drenched in sweat, but safe. This is how rare food is now for the people of Palestine.\n\n**_This GoFundMe is their only source of income. _**They are relying entirely on the kindness of strangers and that people like you will care. They’ve lost nearly everything—except hope. And you can help keep that hope alive.\n\nEvery single donation goes directly to Jamal and his family — to buy food, diapers, medicine, formula, and basic survival needs.\n\n**From Jamal (Thalj’s father):**\n**Hello. I'm Jamal Rouk from Gaza, Palestine. My wife gave birth to a new baby girl during the war. Part of my family was killed, and my home was destroyed. I hope you won't ignore me. I need help to buy food and medicine. The money you send could save my life, my daughter's life, and the life of my family. Please don’t leave us alone.**\n\nThis family is so full of love, resilience, and gratitude. Despite having lost so much, they continue to hope. Please don’t scroll past. Every single dollar can mean the difference between life and death for them — especially for baby Thalj.\n\n**If you’ve ever wondered if your donation matters: this is where it matters most. Right here. Right now.**\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.\nFree Palestine\n— Rachel\n",

They have survived several displacements and now are struggling to survive a famine.\nThe funds raised will be used to purchase food and supplies to sustain daily life in Palestine, with no aid entering the cost of survival has increased exponentially:\n• The cost of flour is $500 - $700 USD\n• The cost of laundry soap is $60 - $50 USD\n• The cost of shampoo is $50 - $80 USD\n• The cost of one apple is $15 USD\n• The cost of one tent is $1500 - $5000 USD\n• The cost of displacement to move from one location to a new \"safe zone\" costs $500 - $1000 USD———————————————————————————————————————Here is a message from Sami:\nHello, I am Sami from Palestine. I am only 19 years old and I lost my home and my job. I live with my mother and two siblings. I used to work in a supermarket and save money for my family through this work. Before the war, I was professionally studying in an Industrial College in the Home Appliance Maintenance Department, but my college was destroyed.\nUnfortunately, my future I planned for has been completely destroyed. I have been displaced several times throughout this war. In the beginning, I was displaced from Palestine to the town of Nuseirat, then to Rafah, then to Deir al-Balah, the Eastern region, then to this strange area we are in now. Unfortunately, we have to live in tents, and our lives have become very difficult, and life is very expensive. I hope that you will help me by donating to save my family from the war.   We greatly appreciate any support you can offer and if you cannot donate, please consider sharing the campaign. \n",

Given the blockade, prices in Gaza are so expensive that they are unable to afford them. Once the borders reopen, Rateb and his family will evacuate to Egypt.\n\nEvery donation helps. Funds go directly to the family for essentials like food, clean water, and clothing. Please donate what you can, and share this emergency fundraising with your friends and family. Follow @rateb\\_quffa2 on Instagram (his new account) to see the impact of your support.\n\nThis family has been VERIFIED THAT THEY ARE IN GAZA through a call to Rateb.\nMy name is Nicole Wan, and I am a friend of the Quffa family. I am from the United States--GoFundMe is not available in Gaza, which is why I am helping facilitate this website. 100% of the money raised in this fundraiser will be wired to Rateb's bank account. Rateb and I met through mutual friends that volunteer to help the crisis in Gaza. Last year his emergency aid fund was shut down, so I reopened it on this page. I am raising money for Rateb’s family because I want to do what I can to protect human rights. No one should ever be forced to exist in these conditions.\n",

For years, I have dedicated my life to caring for the most fragile lives—newborns, premature babies, and infants under one year old. Even during the Israeli aggression, I worked tirelessly around the clock to ensure these vulnerable newborns received the care they desperately needed. I’ve seen firsthand how even in the darkest moments, the resilience of the human spirit shines brightest through the innocent smiles of these tiny miracles.\n\nToday, I turn to you, not just as a nurse, but as a husband and father. My wife, Islam, and I have three beautiful children—Adam (3 years old), Hussein (6 years old), and Amira (9 years old). Like so many families in Gaza, we have lost everything during the recent conflict. Our home was reduced to rubble, and with it, all the essentials we worked so hard to provide for our children.\n\nThe challenges we now face are overwhelming. Rebuilding our lives feels like an impossible task, but we believe in the power of compassion and community to help us start anew.\n\n**What your support will achieve:**\n\n- **Leaving the Gaza Strip: **Unfortunately, the borders remain closed and, when they were open, leaving the Gaza Strip was associated with high costs. The money raised will help us cover part of these expenses and begin anew somewhere in peace.\n- **Providing essentials:** Everything we owned—clothing, furniture, school supplies, and basic necessities—has been lost. Your generosity will help us replace these items to meet our family’s everyday needs.\n- **Getting our children back to school: **Amira, Hussein, and Adam deserve a chance to continue their education and rebuild their futures. Your help will ensure they have the supplies, uniforms, and stability needed to return to school with dignity, when possible.\n- **Supporting my work:** Stability at home will allow me to continue my work as a nurse, caring for the most vulnerable babies in our community. This is not just about rebuilding my family—it’s about giving back to a community that is struggling together.\n\n**Why now?**\n\nThis moment is critical. The Israeli aggression is worsening by the day. There’s barely any food left, and when you do find some, the cost is prohibitively high. If we have to leave at a moment’s notice, we’ll need funds to start anew and survive without any of our belongings. Every donation, no matter the size, brings us closer to safety, stability, and hope.\n\n**Your impact**\n\nBy supporting our family, you’re not only helping us rebuild our lives—you’re enabling a father to care for his children, a mother to nurture her family, and a nurse to continue saving lives. Together, we can show that even in the face of devastation, humanity, kindness, and solidarity can overcome any hardship.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for considering our story and for standing with us during this difficult time. Your generosity means more than words can express—it means hope, resilience, and a future for our children.\n\nWith deepest gratitude,\nMohammed, Islam, Adam, Hussein and Amira\n",

If you could donate to my children and help me get a tent, and send the link to your friends, I would be grateful to you for the rest of my life.

Walid’s mother requires continuous medical treatment and medication, yet no one is currently able to meet these essential needs.\n\n### **Why Walid Needs Your Help**\n- **Medical Care for a Sick Mother:** Ongoing treatment and medication are critical to keep her alive and stable.\n- **Basic Necessities:** Food, clean water, clothing, and temporary shelter are urgently required.\n- **Financial Support:** Without any source of income, Walid’s family is unable to afford even the most basic items.\n### **How Your Support Can Make a Difference**\nYour contribution will do more than provide financial aid—it offers hope, restores dignity, and empowers Walid to rebuild his life with strength and purpose. Even a modest donation can:\n1. **Cover the cost of life‑saving medication for his mother.**\n2. **Provide a reliable source of food and water for the family.**\n3. **Help secure more stable shelter as they transition from a tent.**\n### **Join Walid on the Path to Safety and Renewal**\nEvery dollar, every word of encouragement, and every share of Walid’s story brings us closer to a future where he and his family can thrive again.

The occupation destroyed my beautiful village, and bombed the house where I grew up with my mother, father, three brothers and two sisters: Ayham (16), Yusra (13), Rahaf (20), Adham (24), Malek (23), my mother (48), and my father (53). Here we were displaced from our village of Khuza'a to the Rafah area (near the Egyptian border). We live in a displacement tent. We have been here for 260 days of suffering and pain, and the situation is very difficult. I cannot describe to you the enormous suffering we are living here. We suffer from a lot of fear and tension. The sounds of explosions are heard everywhere, and we suffer from high food prices, medical neglect, shortages of medicines, the spread of infectious diseases, and the lack of safe drinking water. Two of my sisters have been exposed to infectious diseases that threaten their lives, so we cannot live in the Gaza Strip. In other words, the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable. In this war, I lost many of my friends and some of my cousins. I lost my education and my future. My home and my beautiful memories were destroyed. I have nothing now. Our lives have been threatened with death more than once. I don't know if we will survive the Rafah invasion.\n",

They have lost everything — their homes, their jobs — and have become unable to attend school or work. They are currently victims of war crimes (according to the International Criminal Court and the United Nations). They are being collectively punished through starvation, denial of medical care, clean water, and all the basic necessities of life because of the continuing aggression on their country.\n\nThe entire family needs your help.\n\nThe family was already scattered before, because of another bombing and the destruction of their home years ago. During that attack, their middle son, Mousa, who was only 14 at the time, suffered a stroke when their house was bombed. His brain injury continued, and his health deteriorated because there were no specialized doctors in their country to treat him.\n\nIbtisam, Mousa’s eldest sister and a nurse, read about specialists who might be able to help him, so she and Mousa made a dangerous sea journey, which eventually brought them to Belgium. There, Mousa received the treatment he so desperately needed. But eventually, he required a high-risk brain surgery that needed the consent of one of his parents. This pushed Ahmad to make the same dangerous sea journey — but fortunately, he made it to Belgium so he could sign for the surgery and care for Mousa.\n\nAhmad cannot work full-time because he is Mousa’s primary caregiver.\n\nIbtisam has not been able to find work as a nurse because Belgium does not recognize her nursing certificates from her country. She worked in other jobs until she gave birth to her second child. Now, her husband, Samhan, works extra weekend hours to send money to his family still in Gaza as well.\n\nThe family in Gaza needs significant funds to relocate to Belgium and to buy food — which is extremely expensive, if available at all. This process will be long and difficult. Meanwhile, the five family members still in Gaza are suffering from severe shortages of food, clean water, any kind of medical care, and proper shelter. They are living under constant bombardment and are forced to move frequently.\n\nThe entire family is in need of our help. While everyone is doing their best to send whatever extra money they can to the family in Gaza, the relatives already in Belgium also need our support.\n\nPlease help reunite this family, which has been separated for reasons beyond their control. They are one family that only hopes to live their life and fulfill the dreams they had before the current wave of aggression began nearly two years ago.\n",

My wife, Nabila (29 years old), and I were living a simple, modest life, dreaming of a better future for our two children—Sham (7 years old) and Mohammed (8 years old). Every morning, they used to go to school with bright smiles on their faces. We had a warm home filled with love, despite the challenges we faced.\nBut everything changed overnight.\nSince the beginning of the recent war on Gaza, our life has become an endless nightmare. Our neighborhood was bombed, and we were forced to flee our home with nothing but our children in our arms, hoping just to stay alive. We’ve been moving from one place to another, desperately searching for safety—but there is no safe place here. There’s no electricity, no clean water, no food. My children ask me every day, “Baba, when can we go back home?”\nLife here has turned into a daily fight for survival. We are suffering from severe shortages of food and medicine. My children are losing weight, struggling with hunger, fear, and cold. My wife Nabila does her best to stay strong in front of the kids, but she breaks down in tears every night when they fall asleep.\nI am reaching out from the depths of my heart: please help us survive. Your donation will provide my family with food, medicine, and a safe place to stay. And maybe—just maybe—one day we can leave this war behind and start a new life somewhere safe.\nAny support, no matter how small, can make a huge difference for us. We need you now more than ever.\nThank you for hearing our story and being a light in this darkness.\n",

His family consists of his father (Mahmoud, 54), mother (unsure), two sisters (Nada,23 and Samod 24), a brother(Thaer, 25) and a cute orange cat. Thaer was studying medicine in Egypt and is not in Gaza.\nMuhammad had just finished highscool before the war, with a strong GPA, and was studying at Palestine University to become a software engineer for about two months, then the genocide came.\nThey were forced to evacutate to the south on October 12th, and his family and his cat went to Rafah. A few days later they discovered there house was bombed for no reason.\nOn 5/25/2024, they were forced to evacuate Rafah and flee to Khan Yunis. two months later they wre forced to flee again to Deir Al-Balah due to the IOF adavancements.\nCurrently they live in a small tent with 6 people and thier cat. They are being told to evacuate further south, but this cost money. On top of that, they need basic supplies for food and water to survive.\nHis father was injured by Shrapnel which means Muhommad must step up. He and his cousin recently went to Zakim, where the death aid traps are. They wre unsuccesful, and his cousin was badly injured with a bullet in the foot. \nHis grandma has also passes away from a heart attack due to the genocide.\nFood and water is very expensive, and the \"aid traps\" are dangerous. Please donate so that Muhommad and his family can get food without having to risk their lives at these traps. In addition they need money to help them evacuate, and for medicine and treatment for his cousin and fathers injuries. I am asking to raise 10,000$ to provide this family with the assitance they need to make it out. Please donate anything you can and share with friends and family. Thank you.\n",

            "Personal Story": "Nour has endured unimaginable loss. She spent years working hard—first building a career in telecommunications, and then slowly building a home for her family. That home, along with her parents’ home, was reduced to rubble in the recent war on Gaza. She lost her job, her home, and several beloved members of her family.\n\nIn the midst of this devastation, Nour gave birth to her first child, Sami. Sami came into the world surrounded by heartbreak, hunger, and destruction—but also into the arms of a mother determined to protect him no matter what.\n\nToday, Nour and Sami are living in a catastrophic situation. Food is nearly impossible to find, and prices are unbearably high. They have no stable shelter, no income, and no access to basic necessities. Nour is trying to care for her newborn in a place where survival itself is a daily battle.\n\nWe are urgently trying to raise $20,000 to help Nour and baby Sami with:\n\nEmergency food and baby supplies\nBasic living essentials and shelter\nSafe evacuation from Gaza\nA chance to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity\nI will personally ensure that the funds go directly to Nour and her family. I am in regular contact with her, and together we will make sure every dollar is used to meet her most urgent needs.\n\nThis isn’t just about helping a mother and child survive—it’s about giving them a chance to live. A chance to heal, rebuild, and provide little Sami with the future every child deserves.\n\nIf you are able, please consider donating. Every contribution, no matter the size, can make a life-changing difference. And if you can’t donate, simply sharing this campaign can help Nour’s story reach someone who can.\n\nThank you so much for your compassion and solidarity.\n",

She is very sweet, but unfortunately she did not have a safe life. She was born under bombing and fear and had no clothes. Now Jana is one year old and she is trying to have a safe life like the rest of the children in the world.\nNow I am taking care of my family: my mother, my brother and his children, my sister and her child. I am also trying to collect money so that I can complete my studies abroad and study for a master's degree if I can travel. \nJana now needs milk and healthy food, as you know that food prices are very expensive. She needs clothes and supplies. She and her brother Jamal also need expenses, and their father, who is my brother, needs to buy medication every month that costs about **$150**, or **400 shekels** in the currency we use.\n\n‏I cannot afford all these expenses, and I do not have a job now. I have lost everything, my profession as a lawyer, in this war. ‏We are suffering from lack of work and money in the war, so I made this donation campaign. We are now living with more than 10 people in a small tent and we need a new tent, but its price is $300. We do not have this money because everything we own goes to buy food, which has become twice as expensive as it was before the war.\nWe are living in a very bad situation, threatened with danger and death every minute.\nYes, I lost my home and I hope you will help me rebuild and restore it, as its restoration needs at least $10,000.\nI also hope to collect a number of donations so that I can travel and save my family and complete my master’s studies in law abroad. I hope that you will donate to me and support my family.\nWe need your support and assistance.   \n",

We do not have this money because everything we own goes to buy food, which has become twice as expensive as it was before the war.\nWe are living in a very bad situation, threatened with danger and death every minute.\nYes, I lost my home and I hope you will help me rebuild and restore it, as its restoration needs at least $10,000.\nI also hope to collect a number of donations so that I can travel and save my family and complete my master’s studies in law abroad. I hope that you will donate to me and support my family.\nWe need your support and assistance.   \n",

Desperation fills our days as I seek any means to save my children's lives and provide them a safe refuge with access to education and health, my last glimmer of hope in this troubled life. Your invaluable support can transform this simple dream into a reality for my family.\n\n**Update: May 2024**\n\nAmidst the bombing, we had to leave Rafah city again, not knowing where to go. We found ourselves among 15 families, huddled on a barren piece of land near Rafah Beach. Our makeshift tents offer no protection from the elements, and there's nothing to sustain us – no food, no water, not even a bathroom. Our children grow weaker by the day, falling ill with no medical care in sight. Each explosion nearby sends shivers down our spines, as we flee from one danger to another. Even here, near Rafah Beach, supposed to be a sanctuary, Israeli warships relentlessly fire at our tents, compounding our fear and insecurity. We are living a nightmare with no end in sight.\n\nOnce, we had hopes and dreams. Our eldest son, Yasr, was embarking on his university journey, full of optimism. Our daughters eagerly awaited the new school year, while our youngest ones were excited about kindergarten. My husband, a devoted teacher, poured his heart into his work, cherishing his students. Now, those dreams lie shattered, buried beneath the rubble of our former lives. We're adrift, with no past to cling to and an uncertain future looming ominously.\n\nBut amidst the despair, there's a flicker of hope – your support. With your help, we can rebuild not just our home in a safe secure place for my kids, but our lives. Your kindness can breathe life into our shattered dreams, offering us a chance at a future filled with hope and possibility.\n\n**_The donation plan is structured as follows:_**\n\n- **6 adults (Samir AlFere 46 years old, Sara AlFere 40 years old, Hayat AlFere 68 years old, Yaser AlFere 19 years old, Roa AlFere 17 years old, Rimas AlFere 15 years old), each adult requires $10,000 for the Egyptian border crossing.**\n- **3 children (Mohammed AlFere 4 years old, Hayat AlFere 6 years old, Fadi AlFere 7 years old).**\n- **Each child needs $5,000 for the same purpose.**\n- The rest of money is for life costs, travel, rent, food, visa, and flight tickets expenses.\n\n**_Additionally:_**\n\n- **Transaction costs apply to each donation.**\n- **Taxes must be paid for the total donation.**\n\nYour compassionate contribution will not only help us overcome immediate challenges but also build a foundation for a secure and promising future for my family.\n\n**Thank you for being the beacon of hope in our darkest hours...**\n",

My aunt's name is Salwa Mohammed Baroud and her husband is Hani Abdel Hamid Al-Mazin. She has 4 children and here is her story.... Hello... I am Salwa Mohammed Baroud, I am 40 years old. My husband, Hani Abdel Hamid Al-Mazin, is 43 years old. We have 4 children.Saja, 16 years old, Hussein, 13 years old, Abdul Hamid, 11 years old, and Mahmoud, 16 years old. Since our marriage, we have been living in a rented house. After 12 years, we went to live with my husband’s mother in the family home in the middle of the camp. We had hoped to live in an independent house far from the camp in a beautiful place. Despite the neighborhood…We were extremely happy and pleased. At the end of the weekends, we would go with the family on an outing or visit a relative for entertainment and fun. But after October 7, our dreams were shattered and we were displaced from our home. We were forced to...We own everything we love. We went out on the third day of the war in the middle of the night, fearing the bombing that hit our house and the houses next to us, leaving 20 innocent dead. By God, we were saved from the bombing by the planes, and we miraculously survived. We went to my husband’s brother’s house and…He was 6 months old, in addition to many displaced people with him. After that, we were displaced to my father’s house and stayed there for two months before the worst decision came, which was forcing us to leave the city. It was not enough for them to force us out of our homes. They asked us to leave our city.We were living in the great city of Rafah, which contained thousands of displaced people.The difficult decision has come, and I wish they had given us time and a chance to go out and get what we need of clothing and food. We fled under artillery shelling and rocket fire. We went out under fire and we also miraculously survived. We went out to another city and to certain places that the Israeli army had previously determined for us. They claim that they are safe, but... Places, there is no security or safety with them and in their presence. They followed us into the tents. Wasn’t the heat and fire of the tents enough for us, where the temperature is 50?Without any source of ventilation. Isn't it enough that insects are spreading due to the heat and diseases due to the lack of cleaning materials and the spread of sewage. Isn't it enough that there is a lack of water and food? We are living the worst days of our lives. Help us, even if it is a little, to escape from here. Searching_**\n",

The hospitals here in Gaza are overwhelmed and the blockade means I cannot travel for the treatment I desperately need. Every day that passes without treatment brings me closer to losing hope, closer to losing my family. My children watch me suffer in silence, and their tears break my heart more than any pain I endure.\n\nAdding to all this, the constant hunger is unbearable. In Gaza, many of us go to bed with empty stomachs.\n\nFood is a scarce and the prices are too high for my family to afford. The hunger gnaws at our bodies while the uncertainty gnaws at our souls. The simplest things, like a warm meal or a safe place to rest, feel like distant dreams.\n\nI feel so helpless and trapped. I want to live for my children, to see them grow up and to give them the childhood they deserve—a childhood free from fear, hunger, and suffering. But my body is weakening, and my spirit is breaking.\n\nI am reaching out to you with a humble heart, hoping for a miracle. Your support can save my life and rebuild what was torn apart. It can give my children a roof over their heads and their mother’s smile again.\n\nPlease, don’t let war, disease, and hunger silence my story. Help me find the strength to keep fighting. Help me find a home again.\n\nEvery single donation brings a spark of hope in this darkness. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness and compassion.\n",
